## Molecular Communication
-------
Molecular communication is a communication method using molecules as information carriers. When senders sent information to receivers, senders encode information into molecular properties like concentrations, types and structures. Exchanges of molecules between senders and receivers are activities achieved in living things. Molecular communication is inspired by such activities and it is a interdisciplinary area related to information and communication technology and biology. Because biological cells, which achieve molecular communication in nature, are very small, molecular communication is able to be applied to small-scale network.
In order to realize network through molecular communication, works from a perspective of information and communication technology and works from a perspective of biology are necessary. Our team do research on molecular communication from a persipective of information and communication technology.

### Bionanosensor networks through molecular communication

Because biological cells are able to exchange molecules with each other in nature, the cells have potential to become devices which achive molecular communication. In fact, owing to develops in nanotechnology, it becomes more and more realistic to utilize biological materials for devices which are very small. Following such backgrounds, our team aims to compose 'bionanosensor networks' as an application of molecular communication. 'bio-' indicates that the networks are composed of biological materials and 'nano-' indicates that the size of the networks is very small. In our application, the networks function as sensor networks in a human body. Each device composing the networks monitors the health condition. If some devices detect targets like cancer cells, then the devices release drugs directly and keep the health condition good. In order to make this application available, our team work on effective sysetm of molecular communication between sensor devices.
